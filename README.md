# A Database of Greek Manuscripts

The _Letter of Aristeas_ makes mention that portions of the Hebrew Bible were translated into Greek. It stands to reason that the books of Genesis – Deuteronomy were of central importance, and were the books mentioned in the _Letter of Aristeas_. For this reason, some scholars reserve the term Septuagint to refer to Genesis – Deuteronomy. The other books of the Hebrew Bible were also translated into Greek, as evident by the many extant manuscripts preserved today. This repo collects together as many manuscripts as possible.
